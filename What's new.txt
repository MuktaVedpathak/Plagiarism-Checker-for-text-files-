TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
-Term Frequency (TF): Measures how frequently a word appears in a document.
-Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Measures how important a word is across all documents in the corpus.

Cosine similarity:
-text documents transformed into numerical feature vectors
-cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space

A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined using the def keyword, a lambda function is limited to a single expression and does not require a name.
